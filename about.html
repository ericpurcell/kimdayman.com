   Kim Dayman is an artist, educator and advocate living and working in the Greater Toronto Area. Starting her art
   career early with a student placement in the Education Department at The Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa On.
   This quickly lead to a position instructing art classes. At the RMG she connected with established Durham region
   artist Wendy Wallace and was able to assist with artist education programs in school and large scale art installations.<br><br>

	This foundation lead her to pursue her Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree at the Ontario College of Art and Design.
	Moving to Toronto in 2002 to attend school Kim continued working within arts education and took a position with
	the Dovercourt Boys and Girls Club facilitating both afterschool/outreach programs and summer camps.<br><br>
	
	At OCAD she experimented with many media including sculpture, mould making, textile design and discovered
	her love of printmaking quickly making it her major and spending all her time in the print studios outside
	of class as Studio Monitor evening and weekends.<br><br>
	
	After graduating with honours in 2007 she took a position at the Living Arts Centre in Mississauga as the
	Administrator and Program Assistant for their Studio Arts Department. In this role she was able get more
	experience curatorally working under curator Cole Swanson, while growing her own body of work through group
	exhibitions.<br><br>
	
	Accepting a position with Toronto community arts heavyweights Art Starts in 2010 she became their Administration 
	and Communications Manager as well as occasional arts facilitator for ongoing programs. Not wanting to lose ties
	to Mississauga she also returned to the Living Arts Centre to teach courses and workshops in fibre arts and printmaking.<br><br>
	
	In early 2011, missing the community environment from the studios at OCAD Kim joined the artist collective inPrint.
	Working with a solid group of printmakers has motivated Kim, pushing her work forward and created new opportunities 
	for arts exhibitions and community involvement across the GTA including Brampton, Mississauga, Scarborough and 
	Etobicoke. Participating in events like the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition, Culture Days, the OCAD Book Arts Fair
	and Nuit Blanche fulfills her need for involvement in the Toronto arts community.<br><br>
	
	Currently pursuing a new mixed media print series exploring the melding of personal connection to communities,
	history and geography, she is currently working towards her first solo exhibition in 2013.<br><br>
