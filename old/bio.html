		   <p class="text2" align="justify">
		   I was born and raised in Oshawa Ontario. From a young age I was always kept busy with various forms of arts and crafts and was keen 
		   to experiment and learn as much as I could. As I progressed through school I began working with and for the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa 
		   and that is where my passion was nurtured.</p>
			
			<p class="text2" align="justify">From there, after completing secondary school I went on to pursue my love of art at the Ontario College of Art and Design. A little lost 
			after my first year it was then that I discovered printmaking. It perfectly balanced my love of art and all things visual with my need to
			be deeply involved in the process of creating the work through many different means.</p>
			
			<p class="text2" align="justify">Over the next five years I spent countless hours in the studio honing my skills and creating some of the most satisfying art yet. I hope 
			to continue my process-oriented work through the use of my own handmade papers, textiles and various print media. This has left me just at the 
			start of the work I hope to complete over the next few years. I have recently showed at Gallery 1313, The Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition and 
			the OCAD Annual Student Exhibition. Currently I am submitting work for upcoming shows and exhibitions.</p>

			<p class="text2" align="justify">When I am not busy making art you can usually find me cooking dinner for friends or hanging out with my husband and my cat. We've recently 
			purchased and renovated our first house in Mimico village on the edge of Toronto which has kept me extremely busy but I am working hard 
			setting up and building my home studio so stay tuned for more work to be surfacing soon!</p>
